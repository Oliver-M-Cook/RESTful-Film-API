Interacting with the buttons should present films in a table.

The RESTful implementation is connected to my AWS Database, at this time the database is running
and it should still be running if you decide to run it. If it is not running then copy and paste the database details from HTTPImplementation FilmDAO
to RESTfulImeplementations FilmDAO so you can connect to the Mudfoot MySQL server
